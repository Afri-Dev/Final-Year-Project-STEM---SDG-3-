## 💡 TIPS FOR BUILDING

### Use Existing Patterns
Every screen follows this pattern:
```typescript
// 1. Import theme and stores
import { useThemeStore } from '../../services/store';
const { theme } = useThemeStore();
const colors = theme === 'dark' ? Colors.dark : Colors.light;

// 2. Style with theme colors
<View style={[styles.container, { backgroundColor: colors.background }]}>
  <Text style={[styles.text, { color: colors.text }]}>Hello</Text>
</View>

// 3. Use constants for spacing/sizing
padding: Spacing.lg,
fontSize: Typography.fontSize.xl,
borderRadius: BorderRadius.xl,
```

### Copy Reference Designs
All screens have HTML reference in `assets/PHOTOS/`:
1. Open the `code.html` file
2. See the structure and styling
3. Convert Tailwind classes to React Native styles
4. Use theme constants instead of hardcoded colors

### Use Database Service
```typescript
import database from '../../services/database';

// Get data
const quiz = await database.getQuiz(quizId);
const questions = await database.getQuestionsByQuiz(quizId);

// Save data
await database.saveQuizAttempt(attempt);
await database.addXP(userId, 100);
```

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Linear Gradient**: May need to install
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-linear-gradient
   ```

2. **Welcome Screen**: Registration works but needs better validation

3. **Mock Data**: Profile badges/streak use sample data (replace with real DB queries)

## 📞 NEED HELP?

1. Check BUILD_GUIDE.md for code templates
2. Look at existing screens (home.tsx, learn.tsx) as examples
3. Use reference designs in assets/PHOTOS/
4. All database operations are in services/database.ts
5. All state management is in services/store.ts
