## Navigation Flow

### Application Lifecycle
The app follows a structured navigation flow designed for seamless user experience:

#### Splash Screen Phase
The splash screen serves as the initial entry point, establishing the app's identity and preparing for user authentication:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User as User
participant Splash as Splash Screen
participant Auth as Auth Store
participant Router as Navigation Router
participant Home as Home Screen
participant Welcome as Welcome Screen
User->>Splash : Launch App
Splash->>Splash : Display animated logo
Splash->>Splash : Show progress indicator
Splash->>Auth : Check authentication status
Auth-->>Splash : Return user status
Splash->>Router : Navigate based on auth
alt User is authenticated
Router->>Home : Redirect to dashboard
else User is not authenticated
Router->>Welcome : Redirect to welcome screen
end
```

**Diagram sources**
- [app/index.tsx](file://app/index.tsx#L1-L100)
- [app/_layout.tsx](file://app/_layout.tsx#L40-L80)

#### Authentication Flow
The authentication process accommodates both new and returning users:

1. **Initial Check**: Verify if user is already authenticated
2. **Guest Mode**: Offer limited access for anonymous users
3. **Registration**: New users create accounts with personal information
4. **Login**: Existing users authenticate with credentials
5. **Profile Setup**: Complete user profile with preferences

#### Tab Navigation Structure
Once authenticated, users access the main application through a bottom tab navigation system:

- **Home Tab**: Dashboard with user statistics and recommendations
- **Learn Tab**: Browse and select subjects for study

- **welcome.tsx**: Registration and login interface
- **(tabs)**: Main tab navigation container
- **lesson/[id].tsx**: Individual lesson pages
- **quiz/[id].tsx**: Quiz interface with dynamic routing
- **quiz-result.tsx**: Quiz completion and results

#### Navigation Transitions
The app employs smooth transitions between screens:
- **Slide Animations**: Horizontal sliding for tab changes
- **Fade Effects**: Smooth appearance for modal screens
- **Scale Transitions**: Dynamic scaling for emphasis
- **Progressive Loading**: Gradual reveal of content elements
