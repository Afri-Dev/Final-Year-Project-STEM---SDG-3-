## Introduction

The STEM Learning App implements a comprehensive theming system built on React Native's StyleSheet API with centralized theme constants. The system provides consistent visual design across all components while supporting dynamic light/dark mode switching. The theme architecture follows design system principles with carefully curated color palettes, typography scales, and spacing guidelines that enhance both usability and accessibility.

The theming system is designed around several key principles: consistency across components, responsive design for various screen sizes, accessibility compliance with WCAG guidelines, and extensibility for future enhancements. Every visual element in the app derives its styling from centralized theme constants, ensuring uniform appearance and reducing maintenance overhead.

## Theme Architecture Overview

The theme system is structured around a central constants file that defines all visual design tokens, complemented by a state management system that handles theme persistence and dynamic switching.

sequenceDiagram
participant User as User Action
participant Store as Theme Store
participant Secure as Secure Storage
participant Components as UI Components
participant Database as User Preferences
User->>Store : toggleTheme()
Store->>Store : setTheme(theme)
Store->>Secure : setItemAsync("app_theme", theme)
Store->>Database : updateUser(userId, {theme})
Store->>Components : Notify theme change
Components->>Components : Recalculate styles
Components-->>User : Updated UI
```

## Extending the Theme System

The theme system is designed for extensibility, allowing developers to add new color variants, typography scales, and layout constants while maintaining system integrity.

### Adding New Color Variants

New color variants can be added to existing theme categories or entirely new categories can be introduced following the established pattern.

```typescript
// Example: Adding new semantic colors
export const Colors = {
  light: {
    // Existing colors...
    caution: '#f59e0b',
    alert: '#ef4444',
    info: '#3b82f6',
  },
  dark: {
    // Existing colors...
    caution: '#fbbf24',
    alert: '#f87171',
    info: '#60a5fa',
  },
};
```

### Custom Typography Scales

Additional typography scales can be integrated to support specialized content types or regional requirements.

### Layout Extensions

New layout constants can be added to support additional component types or design patterns.

### Theme Variants

The system can be extended to support additional theme variants beyond light and dark modes, such as high contrast or reduced motion modes.
